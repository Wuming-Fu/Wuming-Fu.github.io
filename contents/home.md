I am a senior undergraduate student at the School of EECS, Peking University. Before becoming an undergraduate student of Peking University , I received my high school education in Shanghai High School, Shanghai, China. 

My research is primarily concerned with applying deep learning to study semantic scene understanding, which is one of the key building blocks of autonomous robots working in dynamic, real-world environments. Semantic scene understanding refers to the ability of a computer system or a neural network model to analyze and interpret visual information in a scene at a semantic level. This involves comprehending the meaning and relationships of different objects, entities, and their interactions within an image or a video.

I am particularly interested in LiDAR-only semantic segmentation using data captured from rotating 3D LiDARs such as the commonly used Velodyne scanners. The goal is to accurately perform semantic segmentation of LiDAR-only point clouds on the homebrew PKU-POSS dataset. Currently I am only concerned with segmentation using only LiDAR data. However, it would be interesting to think about how can RGB data help with this task.

I work under the supervision of Peking University Professor Huijing Zhao. The lab's name is PKU-POSS.
