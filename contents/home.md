I am a senior undergraduate student at the School of EECS, Peking University. Before becoming an undergraduate student of Peking University , I received my high school education in Shanghai High School, Shanghai, China. During summer holiday I worked as a quant researcher intern for X-square, a leading professional asset management and investment decision-making service provider in China, co-advised by Dr. Kun Gao and Dr. Xingwei Wu. During my period of internship, I was focusing on applying machine learning algorithms and big data integration techniques to data management and feature engineering to produce data products aimed at boosting the power of algorithm-driven asset management and decision making for our clients. As a result, I successfully provided a whole package of professional algorithm products containing meticulously-engineered features for our clients. Also, during my internship at China Merchants Bank, I planned, organized, and directed specific data analysis projects and research projects on algorithmic decision-making, under the supervision of Qian Su.


My research is primarily concerned with applying machine learning to study decision-making process in order to better determine the human behavior in various financial situations. My research focuses on the creation of quantitative models that characterize and forecast human behavioral traits, including strategies. These models have broad applicability in enhancing management practices across various domains, such as marketing and finance.
